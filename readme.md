# CRT shader demo.

This demo uses a multipass post-processing technique to achieve ghosting, variable scanlines, and fluorescent glow effects like that found on vintage CRT monitors.

Additionally, it supports a gamepad demo where the 3D gamepad on the screen would move according to what buttons are pressed. This is a small test before I implement it into the [Solitaire](https://github.com/salaadas/solitaire) game as a controller remap HUD.

Here are some of the images:
